        Ever on and on, I continue circling
        With nothing but my hate and the carousel of agony
        Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
        And suddenly I see that I can't break free, I'm
    
        Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
        With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
        To tell me who I am! Who I was!
        Uncertainty enveloping my mind
        Till I can't break free and
    
        Maybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real
        But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
        So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside
        And I wish I could live feeling nothing but the night
        You could tell me what to say, you could tell me where to go
        But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know
        If I make another move, there'll be no more turning back
        Because everything would change, and it all would fade to black
    
        Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?
        Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
        Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay or should I go?
        I've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?
        Can I take another step? I've done everything I can
        All the people that I see, they will never understand
        If I find a way to change, if I step into the light
        Then I'll never be the same and it all will fade to white
    
        Ever on and on, I continue circling
        With nothing but my hate and the carousel of agony
        Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
        And suddenly I see that I can't break free, I'm
    
        Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
        With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
        To tell me who I am! Who I was!
        Uncertainty enveloping my mind
        Till I can't break free and
    
        Maybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real
        But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
        So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside
        And I wish I could live feeling nothing but the night
        You could tell me what to say, you could tell me where to go
        But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know
        If I make another move, there'll be no more turning back
        Because everything would change, and it all would fade to black
    
        Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?
        Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
        Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay or should I go?
        I've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?
    
        This time you're not hurting me! This time I will take a stand!
        All the hatred in my eyes, building up an evil plan
        Standing lonely in the night, with the darkness by my side!
        Looking deep inside myself and revealing only fright
    
        If I make another move, if I take another step
        Then it all would fall apart, there'll be nothing of me left
        If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night
        Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?
        Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?
        I've forgotten how to see, I've forgotten if I can
        If I opened up my eyes, there'd be no more going back
        'Cause I'd throw it all away and it all would fade to black
    
        So I'm back here once again, so I'm back here once again!
        Can I ever make a change? Will my heart begin to mend?
        Would you love me if I go? It feels like a heart attack!
        But still everything's the same and it all just fades to black

            <h2>Pure Imagination - fiona apple (kenny grey remix)</h2>

            <pre>
        Come with me and you'll be
        In a world of pure imagination
        Take a look and you'll see
        Into your imagination

        We'll begin with a spin
        Traveling in a world of my creation
        What we'll see will defy
        Explanation

        If you want to view paradise
        Simply look around and view it
        Anything you want to, do it
        Want to change the world
        There's nothing to it

        There is no life, I know
        To compare with pure imagination
        Living there, you'll be free
        If you truly wish to be

        You and me always forever
        We could stay alone together
        You and me always forever
        Say you'll stay never be separate

        You know you've got me in your pocket
        You don't just have to wait around
        You know I keep you in my locket
        Just come here and we can settle down

        You and me always forever
        We could stay alone together
        Hard to say things could be better
        Darling don't get away right now

        You know you've got me in your pocket
        You don't just have to wait around
        You know I keep you in my locket
        Just come here and we can settle down

        Oh, darling, it's alarming thing to think of us apart
        You know you've got me in your pocket
        You don't just have to wait around
        You know I keep you in my locket
        Just come here and we can settle down

        You and me always forever
        We could stay alone together

        You and me always forever
        We could stay alone together

        You and me always forever
        We could stay alone together

        You and me always forever
        We could stay alone together
