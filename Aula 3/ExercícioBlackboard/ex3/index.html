    Ever on and on, I continue circling
    With nothing but my hate and the carousel of agony
    Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
    And suddenly I see that I can't break free, I'm

    Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
    With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
    To tell me who I am! Who I was!
    Uncertainty enveloping my mind
    Till I can't break free and

    Maybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real
    But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
    So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside
    And I wish I could live feeling nothing but the night
    You could tell me what to say, you could tell me where to go
    But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know
    If I make another move, there'll be no more turning back
    Because everything would change, and it all would fade to black

    Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?
    Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
    Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay or should I go?
    I've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?
    Can I take another step? I've done everything I can
    All the people that I see, they will never understand
    If I find a way to change, if I step into the light
    Then I'll never be the same and it all will fade to white

    Ever on and on, I continue circling
    With nothing but my hate and the carousel of agony
    Till slowly I forget and my heart starts vanishing
    And suddenly I see that I can't break free, I'm

    Slipping through the cracks of a dark eternity
    With nothing but my pain and the paralyzing agony
    To tell me who I am! Who I was!
    Uncertainty enveloping my mind
    Till I can't break free and

    Maybe it's a dream, maybe nothing else is real
    But it wouldn't mean a thing if I told you how I feel
    So I'm tired of all the pain, all the misery inside
    And I wish I could live feeling nothing but the night
    You could tell me what to say, you could tell me where to go
    But I doubt that I would care, and my heart would never know
    If I make another move, there'll be no more turning back
    Because everything would change, and it all would fade to black

    Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?
    Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?
    Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay or should I go?
    I've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?

    This time you're not hurting me! This time I will take a stand!
    All the hatred in my eyes, building up an evil plan
    Standing lonely in the night, with the darkness by my side!
    Looking deep inside myself and revealing only fright

    If I make another move, if I take another step
    Then it all would fall apart, there'll be nothing of me left
    If I'm crying in the wind, if I'm crying in the night
    Will there ever be a way? Will my heart return to white?
    Can you tell me who you are? Can you tell me where I am?
    I've forgotten how to see, I've forgotten if I can
    If I opened up my eyes, there'd be no more going back
    'Cause I'd throw it all away and it all would fade to black

    So I'm back here once again, so I'm back here once again!
    Can I ever make a change? Will my heart begin to mend?
    Would you love me if I go? It feels like a heart attack!
    But still everything's the same and it all just fades to black
